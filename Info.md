This is a C++ class named `Account` that represents a bank account. 

Here's a simple explanation of its parts:

- `private:`: This section contains private data members of the class. These are only accessible within the `Account` class.
  - `accountNumber`: A unique identifier for the account.
  - `firstName` and `lastName`: The name of the account holder.
  - `balance`: The current balance of the account.
  - `NextAccountNumber`: A static variable that holds the next account number to be assigned. Being static, it's shared by all `Account` objects.

- `public:`: This section contains public member functions (methods) and constructors of the class. These can be accessed from outside the `Account` class.
  - `Account()`: An empty constructor that does nothing.
  - `Account(string fname, string lname, float balance)`: A constructor that initializes an `Account` object with a first name, last name, and balance.
  - `getAccNo()`, `getFirstName()`, `getLastName()`, `getBalance()`: Getter methods that return the account number, first name, last name, and balance, respectively.
  - `Deposit(float amount)`: A method to deposit an amount into the account.
  - `Withdraw(float amount)`: A method to withdraw an amount from the account.
  - `setLastAccountNumber(long accountNumber)`, `getLastAccountNumber()`: Static methods to set and get the last account number.

- `friend`: These are friend functions that can access private and protected members of the `Account` class.
  - `operator << (ofstream & ofs, Account & acc)`: Overloads the `<<` operator to write the `Account` object to an output file stream.
  - `operator >> (ifstream & ifs, Account & acc)`: Overloads the `>>` operator to read the `Account` object from an input file stream.
  - `operator << (ostream & os, Account & acc)`: Overloads the `<<` operator to write the `Account` object to an output stream.




  This is a C++ class named `Bank` that represents a bank system. Here's a simple explanation of its parts:

- `private:`: This section contains private data members of the class. These are only accessible within the `Bank` class.
  - `accounts`: This is a map (similar to a dictionary in other languages) that stores `Account` objects. The key is a long integer representing the account number, and the value is the corresponding `Account` object.

- `public:`: This section contains public member functions (methods) and constructors of the class. These can be accessed from outside the `Bank` class.
  - `Bank()`: This is the constructor that initializes a new `Bank` object.
  - `OpenAccount(string fname, string lname, float balance)`: This function creates a new account with the given first name, last name, and initial balance.
  - `BalanceQuery(long accountNumber)`: This function returns the balance of the account with the given account number.
  - `Deposit(long accountNumber, float amount)`: This function deposits the given amount into the account with the given account number.
  - `Withdraw(long accountNumber, float amount)`: This function withdraws the given amount from the account with the given account number.
  - `CloseAccount(long accountNumber)`: This function closes the account with the given account number.
  - `ShowAllAccounts()`: This function displays all the accounts in the bank.
  - `~Bank()`: This is the destructor that is called when a `Bank` object is destroyed. It's used to clean up any resources the `Bank` object was using.

In simple terms, this `Bank` class represents a bank, which can hold multiple accounts, and provides operations like opening an account, querying balance, depositing and withdrawing money, closing an account, and showing all accounts.



This C++ code is a simple banking system application. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. It first declares a `Bank` object `b` and an `Account` object `acc`. It also declares several variables to store user input.

2. It then prints a menu to the console with options for the user to open an account, check balance, deposit, withdraw, close an account, show all accounts, or quit.

3. It enters a `do-while` loop, which continues until the user enters `7` to quit.

4. Inside the loop, it asks the user to enter a choice corresponding to the menu options.

5. Depending on the user's choice, it performs different actions:

   - If the user chooses `1`, it asks for the user's first name, last name, and initial balance, then opens a new account.
   - If the user chooses `2`, it asks for the account number, then displays the account details.
   - If the user chooses `3`, it asks for the account number and the amount to deposit, then deposits the amount into the account.
   - If the user chooses `4`, it asks for the account number and the amount to withdraw, then withdraws the amount from the account.
   - If the user chooses `5`, it asks for the account number, then closes the account.
   - If the user chooses `6`, it displays all accounts.
   - If the user chooses `7`, it breaks the loop and ends the program.
   - If the user enters anything else, it prints an error message and exits the program.

6. After performing the chosen action, it goes back to the start of the loop and displays the menu again, unless the user chose to quit.

7. Finally, it returns `0` to indicate that the program has ended successfully.



This C++ code defines the methods for two classes: `Account` and `Bank`.

The `Account` class represents a bank account. It has methods to deposit and withdraw money, get the last account number, and set the last account number. It also overloads the `<<` and `>>` operators for output and input streams, which allows you to easily write an `Account` object to a file or read it from a file.

The `Bank` class represents a bank, which manages multiple accounts. It has methods to open an account, query the balance of an account, deposit money into an account, withdraw money from an account, close an account, and show all accounts. It also has a destructor that writes all accounts to a file when a `Bank` object is destroyed.

Here's a brief explanation of each method:

- `Account::Account(string fname, string lname, float balance)`: This is the constructor for the `Account` class. It initializes an `Account` object with a first name, last name, and balance.

- `Account::Deposit(float amount)`: This method deposits an amount into the account.

- `Account::Withdraw(float amount)`: This method withdraws an amount from the account. If the withdrawal would result in a balance less than `MIN_BALANCE`, it throws an `InsufficientFunds` exception.

- `Account::setLastAccountNumber(long accountNumber)`: This static method sets the last account number. This is used to ensure that each account has a unique number.

- `Account::getLastAccountNumber()`: This static method returns the last account number.

- `Bank::Bank()`: This is the constructor for the `Bank` class. It initializes a `Bank` object by reading all accounts from a file.

- `Bank::OpenAccount(string fname, string lname, float balance)`: This method opens a new account with the given first name, last name, and balance, and writes all accounts to a file.

- `Bank::BalanceQuery(long accountNumber)`: This method returns the balance of the account with the given account number.

- `Bank::Deposit(long accountNumber, float amount)`: This method deposits an amount into the account with the given account number.

- `Bank::Withdraw(long accountNumber, float amount)`: This method withdraws an amount from the account with the given account number.

- `Bank::CloseAccount(long accountNumber)`: This method closes the account with the given account number and prints a message.

- `Bank::ShowAllAccounts()`: This method prints all accounts to the console.

- `Bank::~Bank()`: This is the destructor for the `Bank` class. It writes all accounts to a file when a `Bank` object is destroyed.
